This is my first blog, I **made using Jekyll**. There are many sites where you can host your blogs
1. Wordpress
2. Medium
3. Github Static Pages

To be honest, using Medium or Wordpress is kind of surrendering you content to tech-giants which is not good from a developers perspective. Moreover making a full-fledged website and deploying on server is costly. 

Hence Github Pages is the best bet one can take. And perhaps this is  the reason I switched to Jekyll.

### Salient Features of Jekyll
1. **Static Site Generator** :+1:
2. **No bulky Backend and Server**:+1:
3. **Since the site is rendered and then served, Your page-time load will be blazingly fast**:+1:
