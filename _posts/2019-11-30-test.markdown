2019 is coming to an end. This mark the beginning of a new decade. As it is customary with any new beginning we take 
time to reflect on things we could have done better.

To be honest, life has been a rollercoster ride until now. Finally I am having a independent life, work life balance and 
a good paying job. Coming from a slumdog life  to this all sophistication is new  and fills you with inferiority 
complex but now as I am getting comfortable with my role at Cisco and getting accolades for my performance, the 
inferiority seems to sublime away.


Now my main priority in instilling healthy habits in me. I need to work and install in atomic habits which could help
me in long run.

>Aim to be great in 10 years

>Build health habits today that lead to great body in 10 years.

>Build social habits today that lead to great relationship in 10 years.

>Build learning habits that lead to great knowledge in 10 years

>Long term thinking is secret weapon
