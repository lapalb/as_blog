It's April 2021 and the Covid-19 lock down threat is looming over again. This time we are seeing close to 1.5 Lakh cases daily. So many things have happened in last 1 months and it's very overwhelming to go over it. A relationship which was very close to my heart has come to end. She was very close to me and this post is about my relationship and life ahead in general. For the sake of her privacy, let's call her Baby Yoda(She was cuter than Baby Yoda though).

Yoda and I have been fighting a lot there days. Mostly due to silly reasons. I was always there for her when she needed me and now when she is in Bangalore and I am in my hometown, she decided to ditch me. It's hard for me to contemplate this breakup. She has been going through a very traumatic job experience in merchandising industry, where working hours are long, pay is less and work is stressful. If we club this stressful job with covid and loneliness in Bangalore then it may not be hard to understand that why she is angry and shouting these days. She has been the sweetest and most graceful person, I have met. I miss her badly but life goes on(That's what she said to me!). 

Is this how relationship are supposed to end? Is this what people mean by forever? I don't know. Nor I know, why I feel so numb these days. All these thoughts racing in my mind, don't let me sleep. I feel good for a moment and then slip back to the numbness again. It's bewildering how easily people just "move on". They give you scars and then expect you to be happy. When they say, "Be happy", all they mean is "Don't die"

On a brighter side, I have started to appreciate the small things in my life. The Sunshine, birds chirping outside my window, Couples walking on the road holding hands(I feel little jealous though, in a good way), my mom cooking delicious meals for me.


I have started looking for things that need my immediate focus. Blogging is one of them, and hence you will see this blog more active than usual. Driving is another thing that I will be focussing on heavily. 

Being in good shape is another top concern. I need to shed some extra pound. I was about to join gym, but now with covid cases coming up in Darbhanga, I might have to stick to my daily home routine of exercise.

Apart from the three things mentioned there, My primary focus is going to be switching to senior tech roles. In coming months, I will be switching job more often. Cisco has been a very wonderful journey with lots of learning and handsome salary, but perhaps now is the time to measure the depth of Indian Tech Industry

Down the line, I will be using this platform to blog about productivity, aesthetics, tech stack, and technical articles on some of the complex and groundbreaking stuff in tech industry, NFTs, Blockchain, Neuralink, latest development and research in AI, Deep learning. Most of these blogs will be in long format, so bear with me! Those blogs will also be available on Substack or Medium.

So Stay tuned and Happy Reading! :)
